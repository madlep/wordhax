wordhax
=======

I got sick of getting my ass kicked in [Words With Friends](http://www.wordswithfriends.com/). So I figured I'm better at coding than at vocabulary, and made my computer help me win.

Basic usage:

    $> bin/wordhax -l 'test'
    
    [
        [0] "SETT",
        [1] "STET",
        [2] "TEST",
        [3] "TETS"
    ]



Still very basic. Only finds words with *exactly* those letters. Doesn't find possible words from subcombinations etc, but should get that in there soonish.

Blame [@madlep](https://twitter.com/#!/madlep) for all this.
